# Shell Switcher
This program is designed for an HTPC or any other situation where you replace the Windows shell program in the registry. It allows the user to quickly switch back to explorer.exe as the shell for maintenance or another reason and then switch back to the previous shell program without opening the registry.

If added to the windows PATH variable, you simply have to enter ShellSwitcher.exe (or whatever you change it to) in Command Prompt and it will toggle the registry between explorer.exe and another executable. It's currently coded for kodi.exe but should work with any executable.

Once the registry change has been made, the program will logout the user for the changes to take effect.
