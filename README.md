# Shell Switcher
This program is designed for an HTPC or any other situation where you replace the Windows shell program in the registry.

If added to the windows PATH variable, you simply have to enter the exe name in Command Prompt and it will switch the registry toggle the registry between explorer.exe and another executable. It's currently coded for kodi.exe but should work with any executable.

Once the registry change has been made, the program will logout the user for the changes to take effect.
